### [100\. Same Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/same-tree/)

Difficulty: **简单**


Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

#### Idea
Use recursion can simply solve this problem.

The only thing that we need to pay attention to is we need to connect the result
of left and right subtrees by `&&` instead of check them separately. This is because we
need both sides are the same.

#### Solution

Language: ***cpp

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == NULL && q == NULL) {
            return true;
        }
        else if ((p != NULL) && (q != NULL) && (p->val == q->val)) {
            return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```

#### Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(min(m, n))$, $m$ and $n$ are the size of two trees, respectively
- Space complexity: $O(min(m, n))$, because of recursion
