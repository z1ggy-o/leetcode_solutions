### [129\. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

Difficulty: **中等**


Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

### Idea
Use DFS to get pathes. Every time we reach the bottom, we add the number that
represented by the path into a container.
After we traverse the whole tree, we can add the numbers in the container.

### Solution

Language: cpp

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> numbs;
        int ret = 0;
        
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        
        helper(root, 0, numbs);

        for (auto n: numbs)
            ret += n;

        return ret;
    }
private:
    void helper(TreeNode *root, int path, vector<int> &numbs)
    {
        path = path * 10 + root->val;
        
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
            numbs.push_back(path);
            return;
        }

        if (root->left) helper(root->left, path, numbs);
        if (root->right) helper(root->right, path, numbs);
    }
};
```

#### Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$, n is the number of nodes in the tree
- Space: $O(n)$
