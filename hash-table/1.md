## Question (1. Two Sum)

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum/

## Descrioption

```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]


Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 103
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

## Idea
We use space for reducing time complexity.
Everytime we get a new element, we check the hush table to see if there is a 
complement number that has been already checked.
If there is one, we get the answer.
If there is no complement number for the current element yet, we add the element
and its index into the hash table, so other element can find it.

## Code

- language：C++

C++ Code:

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;  // <num, i_index>
       
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            auto it = map.find(complement);
            if (it != map.end())  // there is a compelment number
                return {it->second, i};
            map[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};

```

**Complexity**

n is the length of the array;
- Time：$O(n)$
- Space：$O(n)$
