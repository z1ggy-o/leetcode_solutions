### [876\. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Difficulty: ** Example 1: Input: [1,2,3,4,5] Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5]) The returned node has value 3\. (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]). Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that: ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL. Example 2: Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6] Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6]) Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.   Note: The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100. **


Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3\.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Note:**

*   The number of nodes in the given list will be between `1` and `100`.

### Idea
Double pointers.

Slow one goes one step at a time, fast one goes two step at a time.
When the fast one reaches the end of the list, the slow one is in the middle.

### Solution

Language: ***cpp

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;

        while (fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
            if (fast->next)
                fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```

**Complexity**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
