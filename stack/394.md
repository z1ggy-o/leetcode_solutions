### [394\. Decode String](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/decode-string/)

Difficulty: *medium**


Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
Output: "abccdcdcdxyz"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 30`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
*   `s` is guaranteed to be **a valid** input.
*   All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.

#### Idea
The basic units are the encoded string and number of times that we need to repeat the string (i.e., k[encoded string]).
Have these two units, we can simply get the final result.

The problem is the encoded string itself maybe a `k[encoded string]` expression.
So the whole encoded string is actually like a arithmatic expression that combines with
addition, multiplication, and parentheses.

We usually use stack to match parentheses pairs. Here we use the same idea.
1. We maintian two stack, one for multiplier, one for encoded string.
2. If the current char is digit, we know we get a multiplier.
3. If the current char is a char or `'['`, we put it into string stack.
4. If the current char is `']'`, we pop char from string stack until we get the first `'['`.
We then get the corresponding multiplier from another stack and generate a repeated string.
5. We need push the repeated string back to the string stack because it may be a part of
other encoded string.
6. After check all the char in the input, the content in the string stack is what we want

#### Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N)$, N is the length of the input
- Space complexity: $O(N)$

#### Solution
Language: ***cpp

```cpp
/* kind like a prefix compute expression.
 * the number is the operation. 
 */

class Solution {
public:
    string decodeString(string s) {
        stack<int> op;
        stack<string> encoded;
        vector<string> ret;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            char c = s[i];
            if (c == ']') {
                vector<string> repeat;
                for (auto top = encoded.top(); top != "["; encoded.pop(), top = encoded.top()) {
                    repeat.push_back(top);
                }
                encoded.pop();  // the top is '['
                reverse(repeat.begin(), repeat.end());

                int mul = op.top();
                op.pop();

                string t, o = getString(repeat);
                while (mul--)
                  t += o;
                encoded.push(t);
            } else if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c == '[') {
                encoded.push(string(1, c));
            } else if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {  // the number may have more than 1 digit
                int mul = c - '0';

                char next = s[i+1];
                while (next >= '0' && next <= '9') {
                    mul = mul * 10 + (next - '0');
                    next = s[++i + 1];
                }
                op.push(mul);
            }
        }

        while (!encoded.empty()) {
          ret.push_back(encoded.top());
          encoded.pop();
        }
        reverse(ret.begin(), ret.end());

        return getString(ret);
    }
private:
    string getString(vector <string> &v) {
            string ret;
            for (const auto &s: v) {
                ret += s;
            }
            return ret;
        }
};
```
