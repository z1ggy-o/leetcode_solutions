### [768\. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


_This question is the same as "Max Chunks to Make Sorted" except the integers of the given array are not necessarily distinct, the input array could be up to length `2000`, and the elements could be up to `10**8`._

* * *

Given an array `arr` of integers (**not necessarily distinct**), we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```

**Note:**

*   `arr` will have length in range `[1, 2000]`.
*   `arr[i]` will be an integer in range `[0, 10**8]`.


#### Idea
This is an array related problem, however, we can use stack to optimize the solution.

After analysis the question we can know sort each chunk separately and sort the whole
array have the same result.
Which means, any element of next chunk are bigger or equal to every element of the
previous chunk.

Have this property, we can use monotone stack to solve the problem.
The idea is, we put the greatest element of each chunk into the stack.
Thus, the elements of the stack only grow in one direction.

1. We traverse the array. If the current element bigger or equal to the stack top, we push it into the stack.
2. If the current element is smaller than the stack top element, we need to
merge it into previous chunks. (If we put it into following chunks, the sorting result will be wrong)
  + We store the stack top element to a temp variable first. (Cuz it is the biggest one)
  + Then, we keep pop elements from stack until the current element bigger or equal to the stack top.
  + The idea is, we only keep the biggest element of each chunk in the stack
3. After the travere, the size of the stack is the answer.

#### Complexity
- Time: $O(N)$, N is the length of the array
- Space: $O(N)$, we may put all element into the stack

#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```cpp
/* The array is sored from smaller one to greater one.
 * Elements of each chunk need within that chunk even after sorting.
 * The position of chunks is fixed.
 * let's divide the problem to the most simply situation, only two elements.
 * If the second element is smaller than the first one, they cannot be splitted,
 * otherwise they can.
 *
 * So, the problem becomes, if the next element smaller than the greatest element of
 * current chunk.
 * If yes, they are in the same chunk.

                int max = s.top();  // the greatest one
                while (!s.empty() && s.top() > arr[i])
                    s.pop();  // only leave the greatest one of each chunk
                
                s.push(max);
            } else {
                s.push(arr[i]);
